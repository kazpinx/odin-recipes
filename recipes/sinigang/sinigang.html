        <p>Sinigang is a sour and savory Filipino soup or stew that is traditionally 
        made with meat or seafood and vegetables, cooked in a broth made with 
        tamarind or other souring agents. It is a popular dish in the Philippines 
        and is often served as a main course for lunch or dinner.

        and the dish is typically garnished with a variety

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            
            <li>
                Rinse your choice of meat
                (such as pork, beef, or seafood)
                and set aside.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                In a pot, bring about 6 cups of water
                to boil. Add 1 sinigang mix packet 
                or aboutn 2 tablespoons of tamarind paste.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Add the meat to the port and let it cook
                until tender. This should take about 20-30
                minutes for pork, or 10-15 for seafood.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                While the meat is cooking, prepare vegetables.
                Sinigang is typically made with vegetables such as
                radishes, okra, and eggplant.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Once the meat is cooked, add the vegetables to 
                the pot and let the cook until tender.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Serve the sinigang hot, with rice on the side.
                Enjoy!
            </li>
