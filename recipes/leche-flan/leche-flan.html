            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, melt the sugar over medium heat until it turns a golden brown color.
                Quickly pour the melted sugar into a round baking dish and tilt the dish so the sugar coats the bottom evenly.
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract.
                Pour pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the smaller dish.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Place the baking dish in a larger baking pan and fill the larger pan with hot water
                until it reaches halfway up the sides of the smaller dish.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Bake the flan in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes,
                or until the flan is set and the top is golden brown.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Remove the flan from the oven and let it cool down to room temperature.
                Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                To serve, run a knife around the edge of the flan.
                Place a plate upside down on top of the dish and quickly flip the dish
                to release the flan onto the place. Enjoy!
